# OSCILOS_opt
## What is OSCILOS_opt ?
OSCILOS_opt is a variant of OSCILOS_lite. It allows the user to optimise a thermoacoustically unstable combustor by varying the combustor dimensions. The optimisation implements a genetic algorithm. OSCILOS_opt is written in MatlabÂ®, and has no Graphical User Interface (GUI), so users run the code using Matlab commands.
